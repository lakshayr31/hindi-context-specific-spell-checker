# Context Specific Spell Checker for Hindi
In this project we design a spell checker which performs majorly 2 functions:
1. It is be able to detect mispelled words and provide suggestions
for the replacement of the word. This is done by evaluating
the closeness of the word with other words in terms of its spelling as
well as has the highest probability of being in the context of the
sentence.
2. It is able to detect words that are correctly spelled however
incorrectly placed with respect to the context of the sentence. Majorly
focusing on errors that must have arisen due to the phonetic similarity
between the incorrect and the correct word. This should be done by
first finding phonetically similar words and then ranking those words
on the basis of contextual relevance.
